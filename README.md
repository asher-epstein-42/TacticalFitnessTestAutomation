# TacticalFitnessTestGradeCalculator
The tactical fitness test consists of a number of different components with different percentages of the score, such as running, sprints, dips, pull-ups, and the x-bar, that together make up the score of the fitness test.
The calculator takes the name of the tactical athlete and the results of his tests and writes the final score to a file with the results of the other athletes and their scores(TacticalAthletesGrades.txt).
